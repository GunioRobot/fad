%(WHAT IS IT?)

Fad is an attempt to make as comprehensive and usable a forward
automatic differentiation (AD) library as is possible in Haskell.  Fad
\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]
\item attempts to be correct, by making it difficult to accidentally
  get a numerically incorrect derivative;
\item provides not only first-derivatives, but also a lazy tower of
  higher-order derivatives;
\item allows nested use of the derivative operators, detecting and
  rejecting incorrect instances of nesting (perturbation confusion) by
  leveraging Haskell's type system;
\item attempts to be complete, in the sense of allowing calculation of
  derivatives of functions defined using various Haskell constructs;
  and
\item tries to be efficient, in the sense of both the defining
  properties of forward automatic differentiation and in keeping the
  constant factor overhead as low as possible.
\end{inparaenum}

%(WHAT IS ITS STATUS? / WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE LAST TIME?)

Version 1.0 of fad was uploaded to Hackage on April 3. Recent changes
can be found in the Git repository on GitHub.
