%(WHAT IS IT?)
Fad is an attempt to make as comprehensive and usable a forward automatic differentiation (AD) library as is possible in Haskell.
Fad's defining quality is that it leverages Haskell's expressive type system to tackle the problem of perturbation confusion.

%(WHAT IS ITS STATUS? / WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE LAST TIME?)
Version 1.0 of fad was uploaded to Hackage on April 3. Recent changes can be found in the Git repository on GitHub.

%(CAN OTHERS GET IT?)

%(WHAT ARE THE IMMEDIATE PLANS?)
